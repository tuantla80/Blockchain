# Blockchain
Simple Blockchain - Python code - v0.0
It is a Python code to demonstrate some basic concepts of blockchain to understand some technical aspects internally.
Therefore, it is far from a final product.

Three main concepts of blockchain will be demonstrated in this Python code:
  (1) Blockchain itself
  (2) Peer to peer network
  (3) Consensus mechanism

I used Anaconda3, which includes the following libraries that use in this Python code: hashlib, requests, flask.
Anaconda3 also provides the Python 3.6 and many other useful libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
  
You may install any latest versions easily, such as for request library:   $pip install requests.

I used Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) for HTTP client.

Furthermore, it is also worth to note that the Python code here is implemented by me after reviewing and
making use of some open source codes. Thus this code is used for my learning purposes ONLY.
